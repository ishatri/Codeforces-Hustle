You are given 𝑛 strings 𝑠1,𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑛 of length at most 8.

For each string 𝑠𝑖, determine if there exist two strings 𝑠𝑗 and 𝑠𝑘 such that 𝑠𝑖=𝑠𝑗+𝑠𝑘. That is, 𝑠𝑖 is the concatenation of 𝑠𝑗 and 𝑠𝑘. Note that 𝑗 can be equal to 𝑘.

Recall that the concatenation of strings 𝑠 and 𝑡 is 𝑠+𝑡=𝑠1𝑠2…𝑠𝑝𝑡1𝑡2…𝑡𝑞, where 𝑝 and 𝑞 are the lengths of strings 𝑠 and 𝑡 respectively. For example, concatenation of "code" and "forces" is "codeforces".

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤105) — the number of strings.

Then 𝑛 lines follow, the 𝑖-th of which contains non-empty string 𝑠𝑖 of length at most 8, consisting of lowercase English letters. Among the given 𝑛 strings, there may be equal (duplicates).

The sum of 𝑛 over all test cases doesn't exceed 105.

Output
For each test case, output a binary string of length 𝑛. The 𝑖-th bit should be 𝟷 if there exist two strings 𝑠𝑗 and 𝑠𝑘 where 𝑠𝑖=𝑠𝑗+𝑠𝑘, and 𝟶 otherwise. Note that 𝑗 can be equal to 𝑘.

Note
In the first test case, we have the following:

𝑠1=𝑠2+𝑠2, since 𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋=𝚊𝚋+𝚊𝚋. Remember that 𝑗 can be equal to 𝑘.
𝑠2 is not the concatenation of any two strings in the list.
𝑠3=𝑠2+𝑠5, since 𝚊𝚋𝚌=𝚊𝚋+𝚌.
𝑠4 is not the concatenation of any two strings in the list.
𝑠5 is not the concatenation of any two strings in the list.
Since only 𝑠1 and 𝑠3 satisfy the conditions, only the first and third bits in the answer should be 𝟷, so the answer is 𝟷𝟶𝟷𝟶𝟶.
